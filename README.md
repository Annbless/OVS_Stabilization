## Introduction

<p align="justify">This repository contains the code, models, test results for the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09041">Out-of-boundary View Synthesis towards Full-frame Video Stabilization</a>. It contains two stage for aligning the neighbor frames with current frame, i.e., coarse alignment and fine alignment. The coarse alignment part is from <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14574.pdf">DUT: Learning Video Stabilization by Simply Watching Unstable Videos</a>, whose code is publicly available at <a href="https://github.com/Annbless/DUTCode">DUTCode</a>. The fine alignment part is based on affinity estimation and propagation. The code will be publicly available at this repo.</p>
